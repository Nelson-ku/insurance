            <h3>What we do for you</h3>
            Costing of damage : the insurance company’s 
            first offer will give you enough money to cover
             all the costs of your injury without worrying about your
              financial situation, it’s important to remember that the
               insurance company’s main goal — and the insurance
                adjuster’s job — is to make your case go away while
                 paying you as little money as possible.
                  Their settlement offer has nothing to do with your physical, 
                  emotional, or financial well-being — only their own bottom line.  <br>
            Compensation by our insurance: Under a voluntary insurance contract, 
            insurance compensation is paid in an amount equal to the losses incurred 
            but within the limits of the coverage. Two systems of computations are used to determine 
            the amount of a loss in cases of partial damage to property not insured
             for its full value.

            Assessment of damage :A damage assessment 
            can vary from loss to loss, but they are essentially 
            defined as a cursory overview of the damages 
            from a loss that is used to determine both scope 
            of repairs and coverage.<br>
            
            Police abstract: A Police abstract report is a document that
             is generated by the investigating officer who responds to
              an accident/crime scene or was assigned to a case.<br>
